### THE POWER OF WORDS

#### Brain connections of words, perceptions and actions: A neurobiological model of spatio-temporal semantic activation in the human cortex *(Neuropsychologia Volume 98, April 2017, Pages 111-129, Rosario Tomasello, Max Garagnani, Thomas Wennekers, Friedemann Pulvermüller)*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The human brain is able to acquire and store knowledge about people, facts, objects, actions, and culture through experiences in everyday life. Much of this knowledge comes in units, as “conceptual” or “semantic representations”, and carries symbolic linguistic labels in language, whereby the relationships between word-forms and semantic meaning appears as arbitrary.*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*A second important observation is that some additional cortical areas contribute to semantic processing in a more selective fashion, being particularly relevant for specific semantic categories, such as words typically used to speak about animals, tools, or actions and their related concepts. Some evidence also indicates that when recognizing a word such as run, activity in motor cortex, and even more specifically in leg-motor cortex, emerges, whereas, when hearing an object- and visually-related word such as sun, activity in visual areas is relatively more pronounced (Boulenger et al., 2009, Damasio et al., 1996, Gainotti, 2010, Hauk et al., 2004, Pulvermüller et al., 2009).*

This study, unlike the general meaning integrity of a text, aims to reveal which topics the text touches in the context of words with the help of numbers and visual graphics. As a preliminary study, a dictionary has been created; it includes 78,000 words and the words have been grouped into moreover 120 different main category such as Education, Health, Culture, Nature etc. Although the idea of the first exit is directed to the field of advertising, it can be easily used in many different areas with the enrichment of the dictionary.

For example, as can be seen in Figure 1, topics an advertisement-text. Moreover, a correlation can be established between the text and sales figures. In this way, the impact of the text to the sales can be evaluated comparatively. In addition, by identifying the general theme of the text, the relevant words for this theme can be determined  by using the created dictionary; in doing so, an original text can be created.
